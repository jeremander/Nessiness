About Nessiness

Nessiness is the name of a glorious company of troubadours who travel the great suburban, industrialized plains of southern New Jersey. Here you shall find all that you seek, as long as what you seek happens to be emotionally powerful movies with stunning, tear-jerking cinematography and/or finely crafted, iconoclastic podcasts, and/or smooth velvety writings penned by the very founder of this website and the whole shebang and/or needs-driven, flexible software solutions through the aforementioned founder, whom we shall forever revere in our hearts as the Founder* and/or any other bits of "nessiness" which happen to be floating across these lower planes. Whatever floats your boat.

* Note that this is in no way intended to slight the importance of the other Founder, who even has the special honor of having made up the word "nessiness" itself. It is merely to show the surprising lack of humility and modesty of the Founder. In retrospect, it seems dangerous for public relations to have that man in charge of the website and writing those savagely witty descriptions of each page that cause so many readers toss back their heads, mouths foaming in laughter to demand that he be given some kind of remuneration. To this supposed peril the Founder says, in the immortal words of a small dog with a funny hat, "Bah!"
