* [Online Encyclopedia of Integer Sequences](https://oeis.org) &ndash; Sometimes in life, you encounter a bemusing sequence of numbers. Maybe it's the classic Fibonacci sequence: 1, 1, 2, 3, 5, 8, 13, etc.&nbsp; Well, OEIS is like a "search engine" for sequences, so just plug in your numbers and it will tell you more about them.

* [Bartosz Milewski](https://bartoszmilewski.com) &ndash; Excellent content on functional programming and category theory. I learned much of what I know from his [YouTube lectures](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I8LbkfSSR58&list=PLbgaMIhjbmEnaH_LTkxLI7FMa2HsnawM_) and [book](https://bartoszmilewski.com/2014/10/28/category-theory-for-programmers-the-preface/).

* [Real Python](https://realpython.com) &ndash; Comprehensive set of tutorials for doing all sorts of tasks in Python.

* [The Rust Programming Language](https://doc.rust-lang.org/book/) &ndash; Learn to program in Rust! This language has some of the best features of C++ (speed, static types), but with much less risk of calamity, thanks to its memory and concurrency safety guarantees.

#### Philosophy

* [Stanford Encyclopedia of Philosophy](https://plato.stanford.edu) &ndash; Scholarly articles about various philosophers and topics, from Abelard to Zhu Xi.

* [Bertrand Russell Society](https://bertrandrussellsociety.org/bertrand-russell/) &ndash; Find out more about one of my favorite thinkers, Bertrand Russell, a philosopher/mathematician/logician whose work was foundational in the school of analytic philosophy. His writings continue to have a major influence on my intellectual outlook.

#### Linguistics

* [Etymonline](https://etymonline.com) &ndash; Online etymological dictionary. Great for looking up the origins of words & phrases.

* [Behind the Name](https://www.behindthename.com) &ndash; Similar to the above, but for names. Use this to research the meanings behind prospective baby names, or to see how common your name was in the year you were born.

* [jisho.org](https://jisho.org) &ndash; My favorite online Japanese dictionary. Especially useful is the feature that can identify kanji characters by drawing them or selecting their radicals.

#### Music

* [The Princeton Tigertones](http://www.tigertones.com) &ndash; The signature all-male *a cappella* group from Princeton University, established 1946. I was Music Director in 2011-12 and got to travel on multiple singing tours throughout Europe and the US, from street corners in London, to the big stage in Carnegie Hall, to Christmas parties at the White House. Check out the group on [YouTube](https://www.youtube.com/user/thetigertones), or book them for your next party!

* [8-Bit Music Theory](https://www.youtube.com/channel/UCeZLO2VgbZHeDcongKzzfOw) &ndash; As an enduring fan of video game music, I thoroughly enjoy the deep theoretical analysis of songs from some of my favorite series (Zelda, Final Fantasy, etc.) on this superb YouTube channel.

* [Early Music Sources](https://www.earlymusicsources.com) &ndash; Informative channel on early music, especially the pre-Bach (Renaissance & Early Baroque) era. A good place to start is with [this video](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TgwaiEKnMTQ&list=PLWoQ_Z2-dWRmXI7KiHep_kG6BPqLEjl0K) on tuning and temperament.

* [Slippi](https://slippi.gg) &ndash; Play Super Smash Bros. Melee online!

* [splits.io](https://splits.io) &ndash; Online database of video game speedrun data. Provides statistics that can be used to analyze and improve your times. I wrote a little [Python API](https://github.com/jeremander/splitsio) to query the database.

* [Songbird Ocarina](https://www.songbirdocarina.com) &ndash; Ever wanted to be like Link from Ocarina of Time? Well now you can, with a Songbird Ocarina! Some of the ocarinas are designed to look like the ones from the game; others just look plain cool. The site also offers songbooks with music from Zelda and other video games.

#### Miscellaneous

* [The New Calendar](https://thenewcalendar.com) &ndash; Throw away your old calendar! And not just the calendar, I mean the whole dang system. The standard 12-month Gregorian calendar is woefully antiquated&mdash;for instance, why do the months have such unpredictable lengths? Instead, we should all adopt this *New Calendar*, designed to divide units of time much more evenly. That is, assuming we can all get used to a 9-day week...
