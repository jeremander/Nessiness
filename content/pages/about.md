Hi, I'm Jeremy. I'm a mathematician and freelance software developer. In my spare time I like to work on various recreational software projects, including some mini web apps that can be found here on Nessiness.

Languages: Python, Haskell, Rust, Swift, C/C++, HTML/CSS, and more.

Other interests of mine include singing, playing piano & guitar, reading, philosophizing, studying Japanese, doing yoga, and speed-solving the Rubik's cube.

Nessiness is a place for my random musings on all kinds of topics, from AI to music theory to metaphysics. Feel free to contact me if you have any suggestions or are interested in working together!
